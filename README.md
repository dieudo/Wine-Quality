# Wine-Quality

The goal of this project is to build an ensemble model to predict the quality score given to each wine from the Vinho Verde region of Portugal. 

The data consists of chemical tests on wines and an overall assessment score averaged from at least three professional wine tasters.

the data could be found here:
